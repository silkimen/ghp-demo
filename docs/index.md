# GitHub Pages Demo Repository

Welcome to mobisys' GitHub pages demo repository. Content is written in Markdown and rendered via Jekyll.

Therefore you can use all Mardown features like:

* lists with items
  * a
  * b
  * c
  * ... and so on

## Subheadings like this one here
Having a super normal paragraph.

### Or even this one
> With blockquotes  like this one. Yeah!

Very important for us - code highlighting:
```js
const http = cordova.plugin.http;

http.setHeader('myStyleHeader', 'megaValue');

// enable SSL pinning
http.setServerTrustMode('pinned', () => console.log('Cool! ðŸ˜Ž'), () => console.log('Not cool! ðŸ˜­'));

```
